            <h3>Dr. Anya Evmenova</h3>
            <p>Dr. Evmenova is an associate professor in the Division of Special Education and disability Research, College of Education and Human Development at George Mason University in Virginia, USA. She is originally from Russia, where she earned her first teaching degrees in English and German as Second Languages. Since coming to U.S. in 2001, Dr. Evmenova has earned MAEd. in special education from East Carolina University and Ph.D. in special education and assistive technology from George Mason University. She has taught students with high-incidence disabilities in inclusive and pull-out settings in North Carolina. Based on her own experiences, Dr. Evmenova is passionate about promoting inclusive and accessible education for individuals with a wide range of abilities and needs.<br><br>Following that passion, Dr. Evmenova’s international work has focused on the professional development for teachers around the world. She has conducted interactive workshops for:<br><br>
            ● Secondary general education teachers in <b>Cameroon</b> as part of the <i>Developing an Inclusive Classroom Culture through Differentiated Teaching Strategies</i> project<br>
            ● University faculty and special education teachers in <b>Pakistan</b> providing consultation on the use of assistive technology<br>
            ● General education teachers and school administrators from <b>Argentina</b> focusing on establishing inclusive education practices<br>
            ● Several cohorts of international general and special education teachers from more than 30 countries who have come to study at George Mason University as part of International Research & Exchanges Board -Teaching Excellence and Achievement (IREX-TEA) program<br><br></p>

            <p style="text-align:center">Dr. Evmenova presenting on inclusive educational practices at University of Management and Technology in Lahore, Pakistan. Attendees include students with hearing impairments.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Many teachers begin their professional development journey with attitudes such as in this quote, “<i>I accept students in disabilities in my class, but I don’t have the training on how to approach them.</i>” Dr. Evmenova’s workshops and interactive hands-on activities always focus on understanding the needs of students with disabilities and creating accessible instruction through the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework. She encourages teachers to design their lessons with three UDL principles in mind: (a) engaging students in multiple ways; (b) presenting content in multiple ways; and (c) allowing students to demonstrate what they know in multiple ways. Participating educators experience UDL first-hand and realize how these principles can ensure engaging and personalized learning experiences for all students, not only those with disabilities. In addition, for students with more significant needs, Dr. Evmenova introduces teachers to assistive technology supports: both no/low-tech and freely available high-tech. Dr. Evmenova’s influence can be seen in this quote, “<i>There is a huge benefit for all students in school to have children with disabilities in the same class. And now I know a little bit more about how to support all students through UDL.</i>” Many teachers keep in touch with Dr. Evmenova and send her updates on their inclusive education practices. For some teachers that means making their own classroom more accessible. Others take the inclusive education initiatives to a higher level. For example, one teacher from Malawi has organized a non-profit organization to help establish full inclusion in the educational system in her country. <br><br></p>

            <p>Dr. Evmenova’s upcoming project will take place in Kyrgyzstan. Dr. Evmenova has been selected by the U.S. Department of State for the prestigious English Language Specialist Project. The English Language Specialist Program is the premier opportunity for leaders in the field of teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) to enact meaningful and sustainable changes in the way that English is taught abroad. This particular project will focus on working with primary and secondary school teachers who will provide English language instruction for students with disabilities in Kyrgyzstan. There are more than 30,000 children with disabilities in Kyrgyzstan, but only 1/5 of them having access to education. In order to facilitate inclusive education opportunities for all students, Dr. Evmenova will conduct a series of professional development workshops and observations. Teachers will learn about enhancing their instruction with UDL principles and supporting their students with various abilities and needs in four English language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Participating teachers will develop and teach inclusive and engaging lessons receiving feedback from observations. They will further cascade this knowledge to their fellow educators. The Specialist Program is administered by the Center for Intercultural Education and Development at Georgetown University.

            <h3>Dr. Mansur Choudry</h3>
            <p>Dr. Mansur Choudry, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, has been the Director of the Jeffery and Theresa McDougall Autism Clinic at Special Care in Oklahoma City, OK since 2004 and an Associate Professor of Special Education at the University of Central Oklahoma. The McDougall Autism Clinic serves children ages 6 weeks to 18 years of age, providing a fully inclusive program for students without disabilities and students with autism. Dr. Choudry began working at Special Care (http://www.specialcareinc.org) in 1997 as a kindergarten teacher, and then became the Program Coordinator in 1999. With the onset of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, a clinic was set up at Special Care for children with autism spectrum disorders, working with the McDougall Autism Clinic. Behavioral evaluations and intervention recommendations are provided free of charge for children and students served at the Clinic.<br><br>Working with students with autism in the United States gave Dr. Choudry the desire to establish programs to benefit children with autism in his native country of Pakistan and other parts of the world. Now there are 4 cities in Pakistan with programs and services for children with autism, including Karachi in the south and Peshawar in the north. They are now in the process of fund raising and accepting material donations to build a center in Peshawar where they can conduct training for parents, teachers and psychologists as well as providing programs for students with autism. Dr. Choudry visits these programs at least once a year.<br><br>In addition to establishing and working with programs for children with autism in the United States and Pakistan, Dr. Choudry has helped establish programs for children with autism in Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. He conducts training for parents and professionals to empower parents to make conscious, informed and research-based decisions about the therapy for their children. Dr. Choudry is well aware of cultures and their communities and is committed to the success of all these locations for students with autism. He provides consultative services to people in these countries who desire to establish programs and services for children with autism. He also provides training for teachers, leaders and parents on the various characteristics and needs of children with autism, research-based therapies, teaching techniques and decision-making processes for determining appropriate techniques and therapies for each child.</p>
