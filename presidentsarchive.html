                    Dear DISES Members and Friends: <br><br> It has been a  privilege  to serve as the President of DISES for  the past year. As my term draws to an end in June, I want to thank each one of you  for your  support and my awesome colleagues on  the DISES Board of Directors. I also want to highlight a few DISES achievements from the past year as well as welcome the new DISES board. <br><br><strong>Selected accomplishments:</strong><br>● DISES website was redone and the social media presence was increased to add Twitter, Instagram and the closed Facebook page only for members.<br>● Can you believe it? DISES completed 30 years. <br>● International Conference Dubai 2020 was postponed to next year due to Covid-19 which is unfortunate. However, we are pleased to announce that we have finalized the new dates in collaboration with our partners. So, please mark your calendars for the new dates - June 21-23, 2021! We look forward to seeing you there.<br>● DISES put out two surveys to help support DISES members and others. We are inviting you to help us and each other by completing one or both of the two surveys below by June 7th.<br> - The first survey, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CT52ZTZ">Graduate Student Research International Survey"</a> is intended for instructors in colleges and universities supervising graduate student research.
