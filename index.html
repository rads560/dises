                    Given the ongoing situation with COVID-19 and the uncertainty that surrounds it, Dubai 2020 has been postponed to June 2021. Our concern is the safety of our participants from around the world. <br><br> As a valued presenter, we encourage you to consider applying your current registration for Dubai 2020 to Dubai 2021. Please be sure to check with your co-presenters, if any, as you make your decisions. To be sure that everyone is informed, we would appreciate your forwarding this message to any co-presenters. <br><br> Unless you notify us that you must cancel your registration, your current registration payment will automatically be applied for June 2021 and your presentation will remain on the schedule for the program. If at a later date, you find that you do need to cancel, you will have through December 31, 2020 to do so and still receive a full refund. After December 2020, a cancellation fee will be charged per the previous cancellation policy. <br><br> If you find it necessary to cancel at this time, please contact the planning team at info@dises-cec.org to request a full refund. Refunds will be credited via PayPal using the same email address that was used to make the original payment. Refunds will be issued within 15 days of your request. <br><br> Questions? Please contact us at info@dises-cec.org. We hope to see you in Dubai in June of 2021. The exact dates are being negotiated with the Dubai planning team and the conference hotel, the Roda Al Murooj. Once the exact dates become available, you will be notified.

                    <b><font size="+2">Update on Dubai 2020 International Conference</font></b><br>
                    Dear Dubai 2020 Presenters: <br><br>
                    Like you, the DISES board has been monitoring the latest news about the COVID-19 coronavirus. At this time, there are still so many unknowns, and the situation changes on a daily basis. We are aware that many events have been cancelled, businesses have closed, and many schools,  have closed through the end of March and possibly beyond.  In light of the fact that the Dubai 2020 conference is still 3 months away, and much could change in either direction by then, DISES continues to plan for the conference, June 23-25th. However, we will continue to monitor the situation over the next few weeks based on the evolving COVID-19 public health threat information. Resources include the US State Department travel warning levels as well as information from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).<br><br>DISES will finalize a decision regarding the conference no later than April 20th and will provide an update to presenters and attendees. We are also posting information on the DISES website at dises-cec.org.<br><br>In the event that the conference is postponed until the fall or later, you will be asked if you still plan to participate. If you cannot participate given the dates of the rescheduled event, you may request that your registration fee be refunded without penalty. <br><br>If it becomes necessary to cancel DISES 2020 rest assured that your conference registration fee will be reimbursed. The conference hotel, the Roda Al Murooj cancellation policy allows you to cancel your room reservations up to 72 hours prior to the conference. Most airlines are allowing for a one time change of itinerary. Please check with your airline so there are no surprises. As for all of our international events, DISES continues to urge attendees to purchase travel insurance as DISES can refund registration fees but cannot be responsible for individual travel or hotel costs.<br><br>Questions?  As always, you may email us at info@dises-cec.org.<br>All updates will be posted on the DISES website.<br><br>Thank you for your patience and understanding. Stay safe! -->
