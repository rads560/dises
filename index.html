                    The Professional Development Guidance (PDF) document connects administrators to information about opportunities and resources that provide professional learning opportunities for public school educators to support Continuity for Learning for all students.<br><strong>Overview:</strong><br> This document provides key considerations to assist administrators, Central Office, and Principals as they establish professional development that will support quality instruction and prevent further expansion of learning gaps. Guidance for supporting the physical, social, and emotional needs of students, families, staff, and the community is included and should inform those professional development decisions. Creating an environment to ensure safety, belonging, and mental health as a foundation for learning is imperative. Adequate support to ensure student success should include training for school staff on culturally responsive student and family outreach strategies. It is meant to help us focus our PD efforts when creating professional learning opportunities for staff.<br><br>
