            <p>Jessica N. Lee (jessicalee1logn@gmail.com) is the sole special education teacher and case manager in an international k-12 school in Umm al Quwain, United Arab Emirates, a position she has held since August, 2018. In this position, she designs learning interventions for students needing equitable special education services as well as for students referred for learning support services using the RtI model. Jessica also leads teacher-centered professional development on the provision of inclusive practices for students who need them and collaborates with teachers on inclusive and best practices for students with varying differences. <br><br> Prior to this position Jessica was a special education teacher for English and literature in Pennsylvania (William Penn School District and Delaware Valley Charter High School). She received her B.A. in History and M.A. in Secondary Education with certifications in English and Special Education from Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia. She also holds a graduate certificate in Mind, Brain, and Teaching from Johns Hopkins University. <br><br> Jessica’s previous research interests were about the transitional nature of education, one of the factors leading her to the UAE. She now studies neuroeducation and hopes to apply neuroscience research to educational practices and organizations. Her most memorable experiences in the U.A.E. are those involving the resourcefulness of her bilingual students wanting to learn and their parents welcoming her into their homes via virtual learning during COVID-19.</p>

            <h3>Sally Loughborough</h3>
            <p>Working in International Schools - In Her Own Words <br><br> I’m in my second position establishing a Student Support department in a relatively small international school program. I previously worked for five years at Chiang Mai International School in Thailand and am now at Huamao International School in Ningbo, China. <br><br> International schools today generally have large numbers of local students. ‘International’ often means only that the curriculum is taken from western countries and is taught in English. In Chiang Mai, only about 30% of our students were from non-Asian countries and here in Ningbo, nearly all of our students are Chinese. The curriculum in Chiang Mai was rooted in the US Common Core and AP curriculum and here in Ningbo, we follow the IB program from primary through high school.<br><br>Special Education overseas looks a bit different, of course. Part of that is cultural - there’s still quite a lot of stigma associated with any kind of diagnosis or recognition of difference. It can be hard for parents and teachers to see that identifying learning challenges can be helpful in providing more effective support in class. Fortunately, all major end-of-school exams (such as the SAT or GCSE) now offer accommodations, with proper documentation, and many colleges and universities abroad offer accommodations to students with learning challenges, so that’s encouraging more families and teachers to see the value of getting children’s needs identified and addressed.The other challenge is finding qualified professionals to provide the diagnosis and specialized treatments. OTs or SLPs or other therapists fluent in a local language and English are often hard to find and they may have long wait times.<br><br>And what kind of learning challenges do we see? Much like it is in the US, the majority of our students have dyslexia, followed by ADHD and some students with ASD. Most of these students have a lot of family support and with in-class accommodations and skills practice, are able to succeed in academically challenging programs like the IB and AP. Most days my work ranges from working 1:1 on skills with students or supporting kids in class, to working with teachers on lesson planning to implement Universal Design for Learning models that support all students to creating administrative systems so that the school will continue to offer Student Support even after I’ve moved on.</p>

            <p>Dr. Kevin Miller (kevinmiller432@gmail.com) is Adjunct Professor at Concordia University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln both in Nebraska. As a part of a Fulbright grant in 2016, he taught courses at Armenian State Pedagogical University Including Educational Assessment, Overview of Speech-Language Pathology and Technology and Communication Disorders. He also initiated a case study examining the inclusionary practices of 2 elementary/middle schools, specifically focusing on how these schools support students who are deaf or hard of hearing. For this study he interviewed special education teachers, general education teachers, administrators, speech-language pathologists, school psychologists, parents and students. He looks forward to publishing his results and presenting them. Dr. Miller was especially impressed with the variety of persons and organizations positively impacting the lives of persons with disabilities by changing perceptions of Armenian society towards persons with disabilities and promoting the passage of laws supporting the inclusion of persons with disabilities in general education classrooms. Despite very limited resources these individuals and groups have made great strides in helping Armenians favor inclusion for all. You may contact him at his email address provided above or at 215-872-4767.</p>

            <p>DISES member and former DISES president Professor Humberto J. Rodriguez (hrodriguezh@enehrl.edu.mx) recently participated with a distinguished international group of scholars to advise UNESCO on their 2020 Global Educational Monitoring (GEM) project. The GEM report made the following six recommendations on inclusion and equity for all regions of the world.<br>There must be clear definitions of inclusion and equity. <br> The identification and elimination of barriers to the participation and progress of all learners is needed to maximize the learning of all students on the basis of rigorous evidence. <br> Since teachers are key players in promoting inclusion and equity, they must be prepared and supported. <br> It is very important for the curriculum and assessment procedures to be designed with all learners in mind <br> Attention should be given to how educational systems are managed and the impact of major structural changes and the impact on vulnerable learners <br> Communities need to be involved in the development and implementation of policies for promoting inclusion and equity in education. <br> DISES is proud of the active involvement of its’ members to promote quality inclusive practices that ensure equity and excellence for children and youth with exceptional needs.</p>
