            <h3>Dr. Robai Werunga</h3>
            <p>Dr Robai Werunga, DISES Member at Large for Membership Support, is a native of Kenya and lived there for several years before coming to the United States. In Kenya, she earned her first teaching degree in Religious Studies and Swahili at the Egerton University, with which she taught high school for a couple of years. Having gained experience in Special Education in the U.S, Robai recognizes that looking back, so many of her classmates who struggled and were held back in grade school might have had disabilities that went undiagnosed.<br><br>Sharing her experiences, Dr. Werunga said not being able to use the degree she earned in Kenya here in the U.S, she found a job working with adults with developmental disabilities, and that is where her journey in Special Education began. “It was quite eye-opening because in Kenya I had very limited knowledge regarding special education supports for an array of disabilities. For example, I had never learned about special education for children with behavioral and learning disabilities. Back in Kenya, “special education” meant special schools to accommodate children who were blind, deaf or those who had physical disabilities”. In recent years there has been emerging awareness for other disabilities, particularly Autism, partly because of the global autism awareness. However, there remains a great need for education, funding and supports for students with Autism and other developmental disabilities. High incident disabilities such as Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) and Emotional & Behavior Disorders (EBD), typically go undiagnosed. Due to this, there are no established structures to provide systematic supports for students who exhibit characteristics such disabilities within regular public schools.<br><br>About a decade ago, the Kenyan government put forth a national Special Needs Education policy framework that provides comprehensive strategies and policies to improve services for people with disabilities. Creating advocacy and awareness, revamping the curriculum, incorporating technology, providing teacher training, and improving data collection are some of the recommendations included in the policy framework to enhance special education services and facilitate inclusive practices. Even with this policy in place, providing equitable inclusive education for students with disabilities still largely remains a challenge.<br><br>Intrigued by her experiences and recognizing the status of special education in Kenya, Robai decided to pursue a teaching license and master’s degree in special education at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina and continued with a PhD in Special Education at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Robai says the best part of her job is working with preservice teachers to support students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and, working with immigrant families to identify their needs and to support them with the IEP process. Dr. Werunga is currently an assistant professor of special education at University of Massachusetts, Lowell.<br><br>Dr. Werunga’ s goal is to promote awareness of high incidence disabilities in her native country of Kenya, by advocating for assessment, diagnosis and interventions that promote positive school outcomes for these students. Currently, Dr. Werunga is focused on providing supports for immigrant Kenyan families who have children with disabilities to become effective advocates for their children in the US. Her work includes webinars that inform these parents about the special education process and their rights and responsibilities. Through this work and deep commitment, she continues to aspire to making her vision a reality for the children and families of Kenya!</p>

            <h3>Sacha Cartagena</h3>
            <p>Sacha Cartagena is a first generation American, being born in the United States to a mother from the Dominican Republic and a father from Colombia. She is now a doctoral student in Exceptional Education at the University of Central Florida. Her research is focused on the preparation of educators to work with students with disabilities, especially those with severe disabilities and meeting their social/emotional/behavioral needs. For her dissertation Sacha is proposing to develop an online module using Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to teach pre-service educators about implementing evidence- based practices for students with severe disabilities.<br><br>Knowing education is still not mandated in many countries, her mother instilled the value of an education in Sacha. Not knowing what she wanted to do when she graduated from high school, and hearing there were many jobs available in special education, she took an introductory course in special education, loved it, and completed her undergrad in special education. Sacha then taught for six years and went to graduate school to pursue her Ph.D. She is planning for a future career teaching educators.<br><br>Sacha joined DISES to connect with the international special education community and to learn more about the unique challenges of international special education. She loves to travel and has visited 13 countries. Each time she travels she makes it a point to learn about their education system. In addition to touring in other countries, she has done volunteering such as teaching English to children and pouring concrete floors in the Dominican Republic.<br><br>In the Dominican Republic, Sacha learned that while education is technically compulsory, there is little enforcement of this law. As a result, students start education at different ages, graduate at different ages, and about 40% of students drop out before the 8 th grade. Only a few schools offer special education services, resulting in most youth with disabilities not enrolled in school. The country is currently working on large scale education reform, including more funding for more teacher training, updated curriculum, and increased access to equitable education for all students.</p>

            <h3>Dr. Deborah Tamakloe</h3>
            <p>Dr. Deborah Tamakloe, newly elected DISES Member at Large for International Outreach, is a native of Ghana and lived there for 33 years before coming to the United States. In Ghana she grew up in a compound house with extended family and non-family members. They would sit out by the fire at night and tell stories because there were no books in the home. Since she grew up with no books in her home, Dr Tamakloe realizes the importance of books in the home. So she now regularly takes books to Ghana for the children. She currently is an associate professor at Millersville University.<br><br> When asked to describe the educational programs for students with disabilities in Ghana, she said these children often do not have access to education because of basic challenges, lack of resources and the stigma attached to disabilities. Children with more obvious disabilities are often hidden in their communities, unable or not allowed to go to school. There are a few schools for the deaf or blind that were established by missionaries and one private school for children with low incidence disabilities that is very expensive and beyond the reach of average families. In working with parents of children with disabilities in Ghana, she found many parents of children with disabilities recognized their intelligence, but there are not schools with the resources to meet their needs. <br><br> Dr. Tamakloe said this is changing in Ghana with the help of initiatives by philanthropists and not-for-profit groups such as USAID and UNICEF. They are currently leading the mission to create and support inclusive schools where students with disabilities can receive the assistance they need to enable them to attend schools. Four hundred (400) teachers in 80 basic schools have been trained in inclusive education to provide access for children with mild to moderate disabilities. Eventually she would like to go back to Ghana to do community work with families of children with disabilities.</p>

            <h3>Sally Loughborough</h3>
            <p>Working in International Schools - In Her Own Words <br><br> I’m in my second position establishing a Student Support department in a relatively small international school program. I previously worked for five years at Chiang Mai International School in Thailand and am now at Huamao International School in Ningbo, China. <br><br> International schools today generally have large numbers of local students. ‘International’ often means only that the curriculum is taken from western countries and is taught in English. In Chiang Mai, only about 30% of our students were from non-Asian countries and here in Ningbo, nearly all of our students are Chinese. The curriculum in Chiang Mai was rooted in the US Common Core and AP curriculum and here in Ningbo, we follow the IB program from primary through high school.<br><br>Special Education overseas looks a bit different, of course. Part of that is cultural - there’s still quite a lot of stigma associated with any kind of diagnosis or recognition of difference. It can be hard for parents and teachers to see that identifying learning challenges can be helpful in providing more effective support in class. Fortunately, all major end-of-school exams (such as the SAT or GCSE) now offer accommodations, with proper documentation, and many colleges and universities abroad offer accommodations to students with learning challenges, so that’s encouraging more families and teachers to see the value of getting children’s needs identified and addressed.The other challenge is finding qualified professionals to provide the diagnosis and specialized treatments. OTs or SLPs or other therapists fluent in a local language and English are often hard to find and they may have long wait times.<br><br>And what kind of learning challenges do we see? Much like it is in the US, the majority of our students have dyslexia, followed by ADHD and some students with ASD. Most of these students have a lot of family support and with in-class accommodations and skills practice, are able to succeed in academically challenging programs like the IB and AP. Most days my work ranges from working 1:1 on skills with students or supporting kids in class, to working with teachers on lesson planning to implement Universal Design for Learning models that support all students to creating administrative systems so that the school will continue to offer Student Support even after I’ve moved on.</p>

            <h3>Dr. Kevin Miller</h3>
            <p>Dr. Kevin Miller (kevinmiller432@gmail.com) is Adjunct Professor at Concordia University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln both in Nebraska. As a part of a Fulbright grant in 2016, he taught courses at Armenian State Pedagogical University Including Educational Assessment, Overview of Speech-Language Pathology and Technology and Communication Disorders. He also initiated a case study examining the inclusionary practices of 2 elementary/middle schools, specifically focusing on how these schools support students who are deaf or hard of hearing. For this study he interviewed special education teachers, general education teachers, administrators, speech-language pathologists, school psychologists, parents and students. He looks forward to publishing his results and presenting them.
